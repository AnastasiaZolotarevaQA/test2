        <h2>
            <center> Each person needs his own four-legged friend similar <br>
            to him in temperament, character and activity. I think you often <br>
            noticed how pets look like their owners and vice versa, this is not <br>
            surprising, because each of us has our own rhythm of life and our own habits,<br>
             which are reflected in our pets </center> </h2>

    <h2> 
        <center> This site will help you learn about a variety of breeds that you may not even <br>
         have heard of. Read on the features of the care and maintenance of the future pet, find <br>
         out his character and temperament. Also study the history of the selected breed.<br>
        I hope you find this site useful and wish you the best of luck in finding the companion of <br>
        your dreams! </center>
